## SpaceGame

An arcade-style space shooter game using Windows Forms for the visual effects.

## Description

This project is a stand-alone application that provides a game engine for keeping track of multiple moving sprites of different types, controlling speed, direction, updating location, and collision detection.  A graphical user interface is provided that uses the Windows Forms class libraries to provide visual effects.

## Motivation

The purpose of undertaking this project was to imporve my skill using C#, develop a greater familiarity with OOP concepts, and test problem solving skills by pushing the limits of a tool, namely, Windows Forms as a GUI for a game with many moving objects.
Mostly, this was a fun project and I enjoyed it. Maybe it can be some use to you as an example.

## Usage

```C#
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
